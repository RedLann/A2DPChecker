# A2DPChecker
Checks connected audio devices and shows its type.

Android Oreo has some problems recognizing the correct type of bluetooth devices.

**TYPE_BLUETOOTH_SCO** means Multimedia Audio (music and sounds from apps) will not be reproduced using the bluetooth device, which should be connected as **TYPE_BLUETOOTH_A2DP** to work correctly.
